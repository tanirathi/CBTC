TO-DO LIST

Develop a basic to-do app that enables a user to add daily tasks. The to-do web app must allow users to add new items to a list, and items added to a list must be visible. Also, a user can mark a task "complete" upon its successful completion, and these completed tasks must appear on a separate list, say Completed Tasks.
